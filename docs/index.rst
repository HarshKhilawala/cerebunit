Welcome to CerebTests (CerebUnit)'s documentation!
==================================================

CerebTests is one of the three components of CerebUnit, the other two being `CerebModels <https://github.com/cerebunit/cerebmodels>`_ and `CerebData <https://github.com/cerebunit/cerebdata>`_. Unlike the other two components, CerebTests is required to install CerebUnit.

This is the documentation for the **CerebTests** component.
